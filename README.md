- Visualize relationships between happiness score and factors such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, and more.
- Identify trends and top/bottom-performing countries.
- Derive insights to inform public policy and wellbeing initiatives.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following features:

- Country
- Happiness Score

- Freedom to Make Life Choices
- Generosity
- Perceptions of Corruption

Similar datasets are publicly available on platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/).

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights uncovered include:

- Countries with higher **GDP per Capita**, **Social Support**, and **Life Expectancy** tend to have higher happiness scores.
- **Generosity** and **Freedom to make life choices** also have positive effects on happiness.
- **Corruption perceptions** tend to negatively impact happiness levels.
- Top-performing countries were consistently strong across most or all happiness indicators.

## 📈 Visualizations

The project includes:

- Correlation heatmaps
- Bar charts comparing countries' scores
- Distribution plots of happiness scores and contributing factors
- Scatter plots showing relationships between variables

## ✅ Conclusion

This analysis shows that economic, social, and health-related factors significantly influence happiness. 
Countries that invest in wellbeing and freedom tend to have happier populations. 
Insights from this analysis can support policies geared toward improving quality of life worldwide.
